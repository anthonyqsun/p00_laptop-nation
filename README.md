### Description
This app makes use of Python, Flask, SQLite3, and HTML to generate a dynamic website. It resembles a story-writing website, but only allows for viewing if a user has made edits to a story already. When making edits, only the last user's contribution is shown to the next editor. This is accomplished through SQL tables and Flask's variable URLs.
